## I'm Learning About Modules and Packages

Hi future self! It's a Saturday and you were learning about Python modules and packages today. This Python boot camp course from Udemy hosted by Jose Portilla is going well so far, thanks in part to some good fortune in the sleep and panic attack department. It has been nine days since your last panic attack and 11 days since your latest sleepless night.

You're almost sixty percent done with the course at this point. You've made a pledge to watch zero football in your apartment this season. That includes all bowl games, even if Iowa State is good. I will use that time instead to study Python, data science, and machine learning. My overall goal is to achieve a TensorFlow certification next summer.

My fitness goals are aligned with my machine learning study goals. My average steps per day since March have been have been holding steady at well above 10k, which is my aim. And I think consistency like that with my studying will be key to achieving both goals simultaneously. The winter months of December, January, and February may prove more difficult in terms of steps. But if there is a will, there is a way.
